technical referee report

=============================================================================

NOTE:

By mistake I wrote much of the following report based on version 3 of the
article, so if any of the comments below are out of date, please ignore.

=============================================================================

comments on the paper:

        The title gets set in all caps: 
            RANDOMPOINTS PACKAGE FOR MACAULAY2
        so probably it's better not to include the name of the package.  Perhaps something like
            FINDING POINTS ON VARIETIES WITH MACAULAY2 
        (Every article comes with a package, so saying that it's a package for doing that
        is redundant.)


The title has been changed.

        In
            We provide different strategies ...
        the word "different" is redundant, for it is implied by the use of the plural.
        What about 
            We provide various strategies ...
        or
            We provide several strategies ...
        ?
        The same remark applies later on to
                apply different strategies to generate
        and to
            a sequence of the different strategies below

The phrase ``different strategies'' has been replaced as suggested where it appears in both the paper and documentation.  We think the original phrase ``different strategies'' noticed by the referee was removed in a previous version.


        Insert a comma after "manner" in this:
            Finding one such rational point or geometric point (...), in an algorithmically efficient manner is our primary motivation.

This is done.

        Why is "Stab" the abbreviation for "Stapleton" in the bibliography?
        Why is "Staa" the abbreviation for "Stagliano" in the bibliography?

This appears to have been because the bibtex entry created by the citations package did not include a year, and the bibtex style file we were using numbered them by "a", "b", etc.  We have added a year entry to the bibtex entries, which fixed the issue.


        In

            our aim here is to find one or more points quickly, even if it is not
            rational

        does "it" refer to the points or to the variety?  If to the points, what
        explains the name of the package?  If to the variety, rephrase for clarity.

We have rephrased, it referred to the point.

            Change
                as can built-in the function randomKRationalPoint
            to
                as can the built-in function randomKRationalPoint
            or to
                as can the core function randomKRationalPoint

Changed to the latter suggestion.


        Change
            , our methods frequently appear to be faster and apply in the affine setting as well.
        to a new sentence, as it doesn't make grammatical sense as the second part of
        a compound sentence.  Or change the comma to an em dash.

Done.  

        remove the comma from
                The second, adds said submatrix to an ideal

Done.

        In
            where n is a positive integer denoting the number of desired points
        it's the number that is desired, not the points, so rephrase to
            where n is a positive integer denoting the number of points desired

Changed.


        Murky:
            The user may also choose to provide some additional information depending on
            the context which may help in faster computations, or whether a point is found
            at all.
        Rephrase to something like
            The user may also choose to provide some additional information, which
            may accelerate the computation and improve the probability that a point is founda.

Changed.


        In
            between generic projects and hybrid projection / intersections.
        change "projects" to "projections" and replace / by English words.

This was changed substantially already.  The package no longer does generic projections.


        Remove the comma in
            For additional discussion, see Remark 2.2.2.

This was already changed.

        Change
            GenericProjection projects to a hypersurface, via projectionToHypersurface and then uses the BruteForce strategy.
        to
            GenericProjection projects to a hypersurface via projectionToHypersurface and then uses the BruteForce strategy.
        or
            GenericProjection projects to a hypersurface (via projectionToHypersurface) and then uses the BruteForce strategy.

This was already removed.


        Spelling:
                followed by a linear intersectio with that hypersurface

This was already fixed.

        Change
            Notice that the speed, or success, varies depending on the strategy
        to something like
            The speed and the probability of success depend on the strategy

This has been fixed.            


        Change
            When calling the strategy
        to
            When using the strategy
        (Only functions are "called".)

This was already changed.

        Change
            will tell the function ignore such points
        to
            will tell the function to ignore such points

This has been fixed.

        In
            Providing codimension speeds up computations
        don't put "codimension" in typewriter font.  And change to something like
            Providing the codimension, if it's known, speeds up computations

This has been removed since we no longer try to compute the dimension.            


        Change
            If codimension needs to be computed, 
        to
            If the codimension needs to be computed, 

Likewise this has been changed since we no longer compute the codimension.

        Change
            A quick comment, while in many examples generic projection works well, there are some examples where it is many orders of magnitude slower.
        to
            A quick comment: while in many examples generic projection works well, there are some examples where it is many orders of magnitude slower.
        Even better, to
            While in many examples generic projection works well, there are some examples where it is many orders of magnitude slower.
        (The comment is even quicker if three redundant words are removed.)

This has been removed since generic projection is no longer done.

        Change
            , that is we set ProjectionAttempts=>0.
        to
            , that is, we set ProjectionAttempts=>0.

This is no longer in the paper.

        Change
            To enable speed-ups as indicated
        to
            To enable speed ups as indicated

This is no longer in the paper.

        In this phrase
            the ProjectionAttempts has been set to 0 in the Default strategy so that GenericProjection is not opted for unless specified by user.
        the names of identifiers from the code are being misused, as though they were
        English words.  Perhaps something like this instead:
            the value of the option ProjectionAttempts has been set to 0 in the
            default strategy, so that the generic projection strategy is not
            selected, unless specified by user.

This is no longer in the paper.


        Change
            and compute h^−1({x}) which is a linear space
        to
            and compute h^−1({x}), which is a linear space

This has been changed.

        Change
            performing an intersection
        to
            intersecting
        , as it is less verbose.

This has been changed.


        This is confusing:

            we normally choose a linear space whose defining equations are particularly noncomplicated (i.e., with many linear or binomial terms)

        Did you mean monomial instead of linear?  Did you mean "equations" instead of
        "terms"?  (A "term" is one of the things in a sum.)  You could just say
        something like this:

            we normally choose a linear space whose defining equations have as few
            terms as possible.

This has been changed close to what was suggested.  Additionally, an example has been added.

        Change
            this seems give approximately the same performance
        to
            this seems to give approximately the same performance

This was already fixed.

        remove the comma from
            computing the codimension of the given ideal, significantly slows down speed
        Also, a computation either slows down, or the speed decreases, so say
            significantly slows down the computation
        or
            significantly decreases the speed of the computation
       
We removed the command and changed it to ``is a significant bottleneck''.


        The English is murky here:
            successively higher dimensional random linear spaces
        I suggest
            random linear spaces of increasing dimension

Changed.

        Murky English:
            if V (I) intersect a random line has a point,
        Say instead
            if the intersection of V(I) with a random line has a point,
        (The word "intersect" is a verb.)

Changed.

            that rings are (R_1),

        Similarly in
            which is (R1)

Changed

        Re:

            If the option Homogeneous=>true then we use homogeneous linear spaces if the ideal itself is homogeneous. Otherwise our linear spaces are not homogeneous.

        This suggests that (0,0,...,0) will not be included as a rational point in the result.  Is
        that right?  Perhaps clarify.

This function is computing the dimension not finding a rational point.  However, we have explained this in more detail.

This was changed.

since each of the numbers in the list in

      getRandomLinearForms(R, {2,0,0,0,0,0})

has a different meaning, the use of some new optional arguments seems to be a
good idea.  Otherwise the code looks obscure.
