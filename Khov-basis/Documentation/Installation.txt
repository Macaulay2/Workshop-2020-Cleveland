First time installation instructions:

Instructions labeled negative are likely unnecessary for up-to-date versions of M2.

-2) Make sure that you have Macaulay2 version at least 1.15.  There is a bug in previous versions (prior to David Cox retirement conference).

-1) Get the M2 package files from the git repository: 
    https://github.com/Macaulay2/M2/tree/master/M2/Macaulay2/packages/SubalgebraBases .
    If these files are already in M2/M2/Macaulay2/packages/SubalgebraBases, you can skip this step.

0) Open M2

1) If the M2 package is not in M2/M2/Macaulay2/packages/SubalgebraBases, add the path to M2.  Do this with
    path = prepend(path,"<path to package>")

2) If the M2 package is already on the path, try 
    installPackage("SubalgebraBases")
    if this fails, then try
    installPackage("SubalgebraBases",FileName=>"<path to package>")

3) Check with running
   installedPackages()

4) To uninstall run
   uninstallPackage("SubalgebraBases")
